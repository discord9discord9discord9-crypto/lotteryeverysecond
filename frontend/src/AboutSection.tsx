      <h2>The Astronomical Odds</h2>
      <p>
        You're watching two lotteries being played every single second. Every
        second a new chance to hit it big. But let's talk about what it would
        actually take to win.
      </p>
      <p>
        The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338. For
        EuroJackpot, they're slightly better at 1 in 139,838,160. These
        numbers are so large they become meaningless to our brains. This
        website chooses to express these ridiculously large numbers in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this website runs 24/7, playing both lotteries every second, here's
        how long it would take <b>on average</b> to hit a jackpot:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Powerball:</strong> Approximately 4.6 years of continuous
          play, every second, to see a single jackpot win.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>EuroJackpot:</strong> About 2.2 years of non-stop play to
          witness a jackpot.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And that's playing every second. A human buying one ticket per week?
        You'd need to play Powerball for roughly 5.6 million years to have a
        50% chance of winning once. The Neanderthals went extinct only 40,000
        years ago. Humans have existed for about 300,000 years. You'd need to
        live through the entire history of modern humans 18 times over.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are more likely to be struck by lightning (1 in 15,300), become a
        movie star (1 in 1,505,000), or get dealt a royal flush in poker on
        your first hand (1 in 649,740) than to win the lottery jackpot.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website exists to make that absurdity visible. Watch the numbers
        roll. Watch them never match. Feel the seconds tick by. Imagine all
        the money it would cost per ticket. Every second that passes is
        statistics working exactly as expected.
